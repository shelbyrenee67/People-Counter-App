# People-Counter-App

Welcome to my first fully functioning app created from scratch using html, css and javascript. 

In this project, I was guided through some basic JavaScript components to create a people counter application, with the help of Scrimba. The people counter is meant to count the number of people that come through to ride the train or metro. When you save, the last number you counted is saved and you can begin counting a new set of people. 

Some of the JavaScript concepts that I learned from this project include: creating variables, functions, learning about the DOM, researched alternative ways to write innner Text from the MDN, and much more. 


I hope you enjoy this app.
